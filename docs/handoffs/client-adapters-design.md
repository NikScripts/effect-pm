# Client adapters — design notes (draft)

**Status:** design capture — not shipped. Owner + Agent G (TUI/dashboard) discussion 2026-07-24 → 2026-07-25.  
**Related tip work:** TUI ↔ web Group dashboard parity (`cursor/tui-dashboard-parity-125f`); widget registry in `hyperlink-ts/ui`.

Capture so nothing from the conversation is lost. Decisions below are **direction**, not Eng’d APIs.

---

## Problem

1. **Dashboard custom cards** need a clean way to bind HyperService handle fields to UI without hand-rolling `runtime.atom` / `Stream.tick`.
2. **Consumers outside Effect** should still use a HyperService if they agree on the wire contract — Promise/async, TanStack Query, etc.
3. **One contract, two first-class React query styles** — Hyperlink-shaped hooks backed by **TanStack**, and a separate Effect-reactive-native helper family. Plus Promise/async for non-React / non-Effect.

---

## Hard rules (owner)

- **No polling** for live dashboard data. Live fields are push (`ref` / `subscribable` / `stream`). One-shot `effect` fields are queries/commands, not tick loops.
- Today’s `Stream.tick` usage in fleet bundles / `WorkerPoolCard` / daemon schedule is the **anti-pattern** relative to this rule — fix by making watched fields reactive on the contract, or query+invalidate, not timers.
- Widget **registry** (`forKind` / `forKey` / `withEntries` onto `base`) is the designed plug-in seam. Normal app use is `<Dashboard runtime group />`; registry assembly is for custom chrome, not the happy path.
- `GroupNode` name kept (docs clarify: group-tree node ≠ transport `Node`).
- Gate observe surface (`Pick<Gate.Handle, "status">`) was a small SSOT pilot; full handle-projected observe types parked until owner cares.

## Adapter stack (corrected 2026-07-24)

```
Contract (Hyperlink Spec / handle)
        │
        ├─► Promise / async client          (“works anywhere”)
        │
        ├─► Hyperlink.useQuery / useMutation   ← OUR API, implemented WITH TanStack under the hood
        │         (optional: also export queryOptions for people who wire TanStack themselves — keep on table)
        │         └─► tRPC-shaped facade       (looks like tRPC; no tRPC dep; can sit on TanStack-backed hooks)
        │
        └─► Effect-reactive-native helpers     ← separate family; feels like effect/unstable/reactivity
                  (atoms / AsyncResult / subscribe / fn — NOT a TanStack clone)
                  └─► dashboard bundles / cards (main path for our dashboard)
```

### Clarification (owner)

- **`Hyperlink.useQuery(WorkerPool, (p) => p.active)`** is a **Hyperlink** hook. Callers don’t assemble TanStack. **Under the hood** it is built with `@tanstack/react-query` (real TanStack — cache, invalidate, etc.).
- **Keep on the table:** also expose `queryOptions` / raw TanStack wiring for apps that already own a QueryClient and want to pass Hyperlink into TanStack themselves.
- **Alternative helper family:** built on **Effect reactive** (`effect/unstable/reactivity`), designed to **feel native to Effect reactive** (Atom, `AsyncResult`, subscribe, `fn`, `Reactivity` keys) — not “TanStack names on atoms.”
- Dashboard default = Effect-reactive family. TanStack-backed `Hyperlink.useQuery` = for TanStack/React ecosystems.

### 1. Promise / async handle adapter — “game changer”

- Take a HyperService **client handle** (or tag + transport already connected) and expose every method as **Promise/async**.
- Goal: use the service **completely outside** an Effect runtime (scripts, Next handlers, non-Effect apps).
- Theoretically: generate clients for **any** runtime as long as the **contract is agreed** (same schemas / RPC).
- Likely feeds the TanStack-backed hooks’ `queryFn` (Promise boundary).
- Open design: how much of serve/client stack is required vs pure wire codecs; error channel → rejected Promise vs Result type; streaming methods → async iterables?

### 2. TanStack-backed Hyperlink hooks

- **Surface:** `Hyperlink.useQuery(tag, select)`, `Hyperlink.useMutation(tag, select)` (names/namespace TBD — may live under a React subpath, not necessarily the `Hyperlink` barrel).
- **Implementation:** `@tanstack/react-query` peer — Hyperlink owns the hook; TanStack owns the cache.
- **Not** “here are options, you call `useQuery` from TanStack” as the primary DX (that export can exist as an advanced escape hatch).
- Invalidation keys from Spec identity (tag key + method) where possible.
- Live push fields: either out of scope for this lane, or a separate subscribe path — don’t fake live with `refetchInterval`.

### 3. tRPC-shaped facade — shape only

- Ergonomics like `api.WorkerPool.active.useQuery()` without shipping tRPC.
- Prefer sitting on the **TanStack-backed** Hyperlink hooks; Spec-generated procedure tree.
- No `@trpc/*` dependency.

### 4. Effect-reactive-native helpers — public family (not dashboard-only)

Uses official **`effect/unstable/reactivity`** (not standalone `@effect-atom`). API should feel like Effect reactivity.

`Atom.runtime(layer)` builds an `AtomRuntime`: an atom of `AsyncResult<Context<R>>` plus `.atom` / `.fn` / `.pull` / `.subscriptionRef` that run only once that context is `Success`. Not a Node runtime; not a dashboard type. (`DashboardRuntime` in `ui/data.ts` is just an alias for `Atom.AtomRuntime` — avoid that name on the public helper surface.)

#### Locked (2026-07-25)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| Name / home | **`Hyperlink.atom`** on the public surface (tree-shaking keeps unused adapters out if exports are correct). |
| Select shape | **Both** for Subscribables: `(q) => q.status` *or* `(q) => q.status.changes`. Non-Subscribable live sources must be selected directly, e.g. `(q) => q.metrics.stream` — not `(q) => q.metrics`. |
| Runtime plumbing | **All three:** (A) explicit `Atom.AtomRuntime` as the core API; (B) handle / stream overloads when the caller already has a source; (C) React convenience helpers that read runtime from context — never the only API. |
| Return type | **R1:** `Atom<AsyncResult<A, E>>` — same as Effect’s `runtime.atom(Stream)`. Preserve `E` (do not default to `unknown`). Bundle `ValueAtom<A> = AsyncResult<A, unknown>` erasure stays a dashboard/widget detail, not the public helper contract. No `Option` wrap on plain live fields. |
| Cache / identity | **`Atom.family`** with a canonical channel key (Effect-native, same pattern as `AtomRpc`). Lambdas OK via path extraction so `status` and `status.changes` share one atom. |
| Live vs siblings | **L1 (confirmed):** `Hyperlink.atom` = live Subscribable/Stream only — not Effects. |
| Commands | **`Hyperlink.fn`** — wraps `runtime.fn`; Effect-primitive name. |
| One-shot read | **`Hyperlink.query`** — `runtime.atom(Effect)`; refresh / `withReactivity`. AtomRpc precedent; distinct from TanStack `Hyperlink.useQuery`. |

#### Proposed call shapes (direction)

```ts
const rt = Atom.runtime(appLayer)

// Live push
const statusAtom = Hyperlink.atom(rt)(MyQueue, (q) => q.status)
const metricsAtom = Hyperlink.atom(rt)(MyQueue, (q) => q.metrics.stream)

// Command
const pause = Hyperlink.fn(rt)(MyQueue, (q) => q.pause)

// One-shot read (L1 sibling — not atom)
const seed = Hyperlink.query(rt)(MyQueue, (q) => q.metrics.query({ limit: 50 }))

// B — already-resolved source
Hyperlink.atom(handle.status)
Hyperlink.atom(handle.metrics.stream)

// C — React convenience (provider holds Atom.AtomRuntime + registry)
const statusAtom = Hyperlink.useServiceAtom(MyQueue, (q) => q.status)
```

| Handle field | Direction | Behavior |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| `ref` / `subscribable` / `stream` | `Hyperlink.atom` | Push → `Atom<AsyncResult<A, E>>` |
| `effect` (read) | `Hyperlink.query` | `runtime.atom(Effect)`; refresh / `withReactivity` |
| `effect` (command) | `Hyperlink.fn` | `runtime.fn` — same as today’s pause/resume |

**Do not** name/shape this family as a TanStack clone. Native = `Atom`, `AsyncResult`, mount/subscribe, `fn`, optional `withReactivity` / `swr`.  
(`query` here is the AtomRpc-shaped Effect-reactive helper — not TanStack; TanStack lane is `Hyperlink.useQuery`.)

#### Effect-reactive surface (locked)

```ts
Hyperlink.atom   // live push (Subscribable | Stream)
Hyperlink.query  // one-shot Effect read
Hyperlink.fn     // command
// + form B (handle/stream) and form C (React convenience) on atom / as needed
```

#### Still to lock

- Relation to hand-written bundles (`queueBundle`, …) vs Spec generation.
- Shared Spec walker with Promise adapter vs separate.

---

## Dashboard context (already shipped / in flight)

- Shared `hyperlink-ts/ui`: data bundles, `groupRoute`, `memberKind` / `wireKindOf`, widget registry.
- Web + TUI: `<Dashboard runtime group path? widgets? />`; default `base` registry.
- Custom example: `examples/resource-web` — `withEntries(base, [forKey(WorkerPool.key, WorkerPoolCard)])`.
- TUI kind cells for gate/api/fleetHealth/telemetry/shardMap; unknown leaves show kind + node.

---

## Non-goals (for now)

- Polling helpers as the live-data API.
- Selling `widgets={withEntries…}` as the primary Dashboard DX.
- Full observe-surface `Pick` across every handle type (parked).
- Actually depending on tRPC.

---

## Next conversation

Relation to bundles / Spec generation; shared Spec walker with Promise adapter. TanStack-backed `Hyperlink.useQuery` + `queryOptions` escape hatch still on table. Promise adapter as shared boundary for TanStack `queryFn`.
