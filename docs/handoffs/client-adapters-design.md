# Client adapters — design notes (draft)

**Status:** design capture — not shipped. Owner + Agent G (TUI/dashboard) discussion 2026-07-24.  
**Related tip work:** TUI ↔ web Group dashboard parity (`cursor/tui-dashboard-parity-125f`); widget registry in `hyperlink-ts/ui`.

Capture so nothing from the conversation is lost. Decisions below are **direction**, not Eng’d APIs.

---

## Problem

1. **Dashboard custom cards** need a clean way to bind HyperService handle fields to UI without hand-rolling `runtime.atom` / `Stream.tick`.
2. **Consumers outside Effect** should still use a HyperService if they agree on the wire contract — Promise/async, TanStack Query, etc.
3. **One contract, two first-class React query styles** — Hyperlink-shaped hooks backed by **TanStack**, and a separate Effect-reactive-native helper family. Plus Promise/async for non-React / non-Effect.

---

## Hard rules (owner)

- **No polling** for live dashboard data. Live fields are push (`ref` / `subscribable` / `stream`). One-shot `effect` fields are queries/commands, not tick loops.
- Today’s `Stream.tick` usage in fleet bundles / `WorkerPoolCard` / daemon schedule is the **anti-pattern** relative to this rule — fix by making watched fields reactive on the contract, or query+invalidate, not timers.
- Widget **registry** (`forKind` / `forKey` / `withEntries` onto `base`) is the designed plug-in seam. Normal app use is `<Dashboard runtime group />`; registry assembly is for custom chrome, not the happy path.
- `GroupNode` name kept (docs clarify: group-tree node ≠ transport `Node`).
- Gate observe surface (`Pick<Gate.Handle, "status">`) was a small SSOT pilot; full handle-projected observe types parked until owner cares.

## Adapter stack (corrected 2026-07-24)

```
Contract (Hyperlink Spec / handle)
        │
        ├─► Promise / async client          (“works anywhere”)
        │
        ├─► Hyperlink.useQuery / useMutation   ← OUR API, implemented WITH TanStack under the hood
        │         (optional: also export queryOptions for people who wire TanStack themselves — keep on table)
        │         └─► tRPC-shaped facade       (looks like tRPC; no tRPC dep; can sit on TanStack-backed hooks)
        │
        └─► Effect-reactive-native helpers     ← separate family; feels like effect/unstable/reactivity
                  (atoms / AsyncResult / subscribe / fn — NOT a TanStack clone)
                  └─► dashboard bundles / cards (main path for our dashboard)
```

### Clarification (owner)

- **`Hyperlink.useQuery(WorkerPool, (p) => p.active)`** is a **Hyperlink** hook. Callers don’t assemble TanStack. **Under the hood** it is built with `@tanstack/react-query` (real TanStack — cache, invalidate, etc.).
- **Keep on the table:** also expose `queryOptions` / raw TanStack wiring for apps that already own a QueryClient and want to pass Hyperlink into TanStack themselves.
- **Alternative helper family:** built on **Effect reactive** (`effect/unstable/reactivity`), designed to **feel native to Effect reactive** (Atom, `AsyncResult`, subscribe, `fn`, `Reactivity` keys) — not “TanStack names on atoms.”
- Dashboard default = Effect-reactive family. TanStack-backed `Hyperlink.useQuery` = for TanStack/React ecosystems.

### 1. Promise / async handle adapter — “game changer”

- Take a HyperService **client handle** (or tag + transport already connected) and expose every method as **Promise/async**.
- Goal: use the service **completely outside** an Effect runtime (scripts, Next handlers, non-Effect apps).
- Theoretically: generate clients for **any** runtime as long as the **contract is agreed** (same schemas / RPC).
- Likely feeds the TanStack-backed hooks’ `queryFn` (Promise boundary).
- Open design: how much of serve/client stack is required vs pure wire codecs; error channel → rejected Promise vs Result type; streaming methods → async iterables?

### 2. TanStack-backed Hyperlink hooks

- **Surface:** `Hyperlink.useQuery(tag, select)`, `Hyperlink.useMutation(tag, select)` (names/namespace TBD — may live under a React subpath, not necessarily the `Hyperlink` barrel).
- **Implementation:** `@tanstack/react-query` peer — Hyperlink owns the hook; TanStack owns the cache.
- **Not** “here are options, you call `useQuery` from TanStack” as the primary DX (that export can exist as an advanced escape hatch).
- Invalidation keys from Spec identity (tag key + method) where possible.
- Live push fields: either out of scope for this lane, or a separate subscribe path — don’t fake live with `refetchInterval`.

### 3. tRPC-shaped facade — shape only

- Ergonomics like `api.WorkerPool.active.useQuery()` without shipping tRPC.
- Prefer sitting on the **TanStack-backed** Hyperlink hooks; Spec-generated procedure tree.
- No `@trpc/*` dependency.

### 4. Effect-reactive-native helpers — dashboard main path

Uses official **`effect/unstable/reactivity`** (not standalone `@effect-atom`). API should feel like Effect reactivity, e.g.:

| Handle field | Direction | Behavior |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| `ref` / `subscribable` / `stream` | subscribe helper (native naming TBD) | Push → `AsyncResult` atom |
| `effect` (read) | atom/query over `runtime.atom(Effect)` | One-shot; `refresh` / `Reactivity.invalidate` |
| `effect` (command) | `runtime.fn` style | Same as today’s pause/resume |

**Do not** name/shape this family as a TanStack clone. Native = `Atom`, `AsyncResult`, mount/subscribe, `fn`, optional `withReactivity` / `swr`.

Still to discuss for (4):

- Exact names and module home (`hyperlink-ts/ui` vs `/web` vs new subpath).
- Subscribable selector vs Stream selector (`(g) => g.status` vs `(g) => g.status.changes`).
- How Spec-driven generation relates to hand-written bundles (`queueBundle`, …).
- Shared Spec walker with Promise adapter vs separate.

---

## Dashboard context (already shipped / in flight)

- Shared `hyperlink-ts/ui`: data bundles, `groupRoute`, `memberKind` / `wireKindOf`, widget registry.
- Web + TUI: `<Dashboard runtime group path? widgets? />`; default `base` registry.
- Custom example: `examples/resource-web` — `withEntries(base, [forKey(WorkerPool.key, WorkerPoolCard)])`.
- TUI kind cells for gate/api/fleetHealth/telemetry/shardMap; unknown leaves show kind + node.

---

## Non-goals (for now)

- Polling helpers as the live-data API.
- Selling `widgets={withEntries…}` as the primary Dashboard DX.
- Full observe-surface `Pick` across every handle type (parked).
- Actually depending on tRPC.

---

## Next conversation

Lock Effect-reactive-native hook names (dashboard), then TanStack-backed `Hyperlink.useQuery` surface + whether `queryOptions` escape hatch ships in v1. Promise adapter as shared boundary for TanStack `queryFn`.
